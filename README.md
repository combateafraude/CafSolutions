# CafSolutions SDK for iOS

## Overview

**CafSolutions** is a shared internal SDK used by both the [**DocumentDetector**](https://github.com/combateafraude/DocumentDetector) and [**FaceLiveness**](https://github.com/combateafraude/FaceLiveness) frameworks. This package is not meant for standalone use; instead, it is integrated within the broader SDK solutions to provide essential functionalities for secure document detection and face liveness validation.

## Swift Package Manager (SPM) SDK Installation

As **CafSolutions** is used internally within [**DocumentDetector**](https://github.com/combateafraude/DocumentDetector) and [**FaceLiveness**](https://github.com/combateafraude/FaceLiveness), you should not directly add it as a separate package. Instead, **CafSolutions** is automatically included when you integrate either **DocumentDetector** or **FaceLiveness** into your project.

## Usage

**CafSolutions** is not intended for direct use in your project. Instead, it operates internally as part of the **DocumentDetector** and **FaceLiveness** SDKs to provide shared functionality for secure data handling and communications.

For any interactions with **DocumentDetector** or **FaceLiveness**, please refer to their respective documentation.
